## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a **Machine Learning–powered web application** that predicts student academic performance using a **Linear Regression model**.  
The system analyzes important academic factors such as:

- Study hours  
- Attendance percentage  
- Previous exam performance  
- Activity participation  

The model generates a final predicted score (out of 100).  
It includes a **beautiful neon-themed, animated UI**, and is built using:

✨ Python  
✨ Flask  
✨ Scikit-learn  
✨ HTML + CSS (animated gradient)
